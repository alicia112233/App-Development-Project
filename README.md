# App Development Project

This is an e-commerce website that sells cosmetics just like Sephora!
I was assigned to do the CRUD functions such as Login/Register for both the Customers and Staff, Retrieving Users, Updating Info and Deleting Users.
This application is created using object-oriented programming that uses Flask, wtforms, jinja2, and bootstrap.
